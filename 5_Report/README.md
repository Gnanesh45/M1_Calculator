 # Requirements

 ## Introduction
Simple calculator is a project to allow users to calculate basic four operations in mathematics ,they are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division 
but in this Project which I'm Implementing ,also included three additional operations such as Factorial, Power ,modulas .However, the input has to be in 
the form "number1 operator1 number2 "(i.e 2+4).

 ## Research
   ###  Advantages
        Easy and faster access
        can be used anywhere
        Future Proof

   ###   Disadvantages
        GUI is needed
        limited converstions

 ## Cost and Features
 -   EasierAccess
 -   Low Cost

## TimeLine

Problem Statement ---> Research ---> Plan --->Design --->Implement--->Testing --->Execute---> Out for Market

## Defining our System

Calculator application is so simple to use. In order to use the application, use make run command and then, you will have many options to select
And with this user can perform calculator operations.
* ADDITION
* SUBTRACTION
* MULTIPLICATION
* DIVISION
* FACTORIAL
* POWER
* MODULUS

## TOOLS USED

* GCC Compiler
* Visual Studio Code
* GNU/GDB debugger
* C/C++ interpreter Ch 5.0

## SWOT ANALYSIS


   ### Strengths

      We can access it from anywhere.
      It makes calculations easy.
      It is available for 24/7.
  
   ### Weaknesses

      Needs graphical user interface.

   ### Opportunities

      It can be used in different work places and by different needs.
      User friendly.

   ### Threats

      limited  access.



 ## 4 W's and 1 H

   ### Who
     Anyone can use this by accessing its main menu and need to choose there  required field of choice and need to enter the 
     value to get there desired output.

   ### What
     It's an simple calculator application to help user perform mathematical operations.

   ### When
     It is available to user 24X7, 365 days without any issues and works infinite times.

   ### Where
     We can use this at different palces and this is platform independent, it will work in any platform.
     It can be used in scientific calculators or in maths or physics labs. 
   ### How
    This application was developed in C language to avoid the complexity and to keep it simple.
