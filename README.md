# M1_Calculator

This Project is a Calculator which performs basic four calculator operations such as addition,subtraction,multiplication,division.It doesn't end there.I've also included other operations like factorial,modulus and power functions.

The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation for example for addition we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works. Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction/factorial/power/modulas, in another word it is implemented with the order of precedence logic.
